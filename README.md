Here's a README.md file that includes instructions on how to run both the server-side and front-end of your application:

```markdown
# Project Name

Description of the project.

## Server Side

### Requirements
- Node.js
- npm or yarn

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/WhitelightningDev/client.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the server directory:
   ```bash
   cd server
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

### Running the Server
1. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```

## Frontend

### Requirements
- Node.js
- npm or yarn

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/WhitelightningDev/client.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the client directory:
   ```bash
   cd client
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

   or
   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```

```

Replace "Project Name" and "Description of the project" with appropriate values for your project. These instructions assume that your server is located in a directory named "server" and your frontend is located in a directory named "client". If your project structure is different, adjust the instructions accordingly.
